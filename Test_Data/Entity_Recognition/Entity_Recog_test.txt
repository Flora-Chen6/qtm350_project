However, given that the MRI identified additional factors such as chondral defects and a free body in the joint, these factors decrease the likelihood that physical therapy will be successful and increase the possible need to consider surgical options.

There is acute transient lateral patellar dislocation with residual tilt and lateral subluxation, femoral condyle, and medial patellar marrow contusions. 

If you have had an MRI, CT or EMG (which was done at a facility OTHER than AOC) of the area that you are being seen for by our provider, you MUST bring in the written report and disk with images; if you do NOT have BOTH of these items in hand, your appointment will be rescheduled.

There is a risk that some knee surgeries can actually increase arthritis and do more harm than good in the long run, however, there are also cases in which the benefits outweigh the risks; I would recommend bringing this point up with your surgeon to find out what they think your odds are of ultimately needing a knee replacement with the surgery and what your odds would be without the surgery.  

Also, another thing to potentially consider is that some insurance providers will not approve a surgery unless you have tried at least 6 weeks of physical therapy, so trialing physical therapy might ultimately become necessary depending on the policies of your insurance provider.
 
Since you will be driving state vehicles during your time as a Sea Grant Scholar at ODFW, you will also have to meet driving record requirements of the state of Oregon; to do this, I will need 2 things: A filled out driver certification form (attached), and a certified copy of your out-of-state driving record covering, at a minimum, the last 24 months.

The two journal publications we discussed are attached and the government report (40 mb) can be downloaded at this public link: Estuarine water quality in parks of the Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network.

All individuals and entities OSU does business with are required to register in OSU's vendor portal in order to receive payment.

I’m reaching out to inform you that you will be receiving an invitation from our Oregon State University vendor department today to register in our online system to become a vendor to receive your stipend payment for your participation this summer as an Oregon Sea Grant Summer Scholar.

To do this, I will need 2 things: A filled-out driver certification form (attached), and a certified copy of your out-of-state driving record covering at a minimum the last 24 months. 

Attached is a Word document that shows a summary of the tasks you will be doing and the required items for you to complete as part of the ODFW onboarding process

Field season has officially started so don’t worry if you don’t hear back right away! We’re looking forward to having you on the team.

This means you are not eligible for employee benefits or workers compensation, and do not have taxes removed prior to issuance of your stipend; this is because the stipend is a subsistence allowance paid to defray living expenses so that you can engage in this internship program.

Effective immediately, Emory University will extend spring break for students until Sunday, March 22, 2020, and transition to remote learning for graduate and undergraduate classes on Monday, March 23, 2020.

I talked with the volunteer coordinator yesterday and they said they may ask you to repeat some paperwork you already completed for me (Driver’s certification); I will be able to forward your driving record to the volunteer coordinator when I receive it this week.
