The grading process should be kept confidential, including the grading guidelines, grades, and even which students you grade (I don’t want them to know which specific TA to complain about!).
We carefully reviewed all candidates within this applicant pool, and while many candidates met minimum qualifications, decisions were made to move forward with candidates that best align with our current business need.
We will have a guest lecturer in class tomorrow-- please be sure you are ON TIME and use the facilities BEFORE class.
We regret to inform that we are unable to invite you to our Women’s Summit this year; we received lots of interest and in order to keep the program as rewarding as possible, we have to limit the number of attendees joining us this year.
Be as it may… I just want to make sure you don’t give up because life is complicated and arranging meetings is a nightmare.
Because Dooley canceled the earlier section and I have to have both sections run parallel, class today is also canceled ... but you can assuage your disappointment enjoying the nice day, celebrating the Emory tradition!
The good news is that those who are failing to do this have a great opportunity to still learn from the experience without significant real world consequences for now.
It's such an important benefit folks, I'm ok with certain folks rationalizing me into the bad guy role!
After completion of your initial interview and review of your qualifications, we are happy to inform you that we would like to move you to the next steps in the interview process.
I wanted to check in as you are not present in class today and it is one of the final days we have to work on the radio play.
While your skills and background are impressive, after assessing all of the candidates that applied for this position, we have decided to proceed with other applicants who more closely fit our needs at this time.
I would like to point out that you have no obligation to interact with students outside of your scheduled TA sessions. If you would like to set up something with students on the side, that is between you and the student. 
I just want to say thank you for your patience and care yesterday. I'm really grateful to have such a mature and caring group of students! 
We promise that your resume hasn’t gone into the dark void; it’s actually being pored over by a real, live person.
Don't stress Tong. It just didn't work out this semester. It's just a 1 credit course so I'll give you an A for effort.
