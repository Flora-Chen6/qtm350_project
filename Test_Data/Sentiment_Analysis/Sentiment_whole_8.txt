Hello Qi,


Thank you so much for your application to the Xtern program. We were humbled by the quantity and quality of applicants and appreciate your interest in the Indiana tech community.


At this time we regret to inform you that your application for Xtern Class of 2023 will not move on to the next round.


That being said, we think you could bring tremendous value to Indianapolis and encourage you to check out the TechPoint Job Board, Tech Directory. We are working on a career exploratory program over the summer and will be back on your campus to recruit in the spring. Please keep an eye out for updates and information on our website.


Additionally, much like what we do here at TechPoint, our friends over at Ascend Indiana work to connect students to opportunities in Indianapolis and would love to work with you. It is our hope that these resources will help you find companies across the city and state that are actively hiring talented young professionals such as yourself. You can sign-up for the free Ascend Network by uploading your resume here. If you already have worked with Ascend, be sure to reach out to your Career Mentor or contact Alice Lawson (alice.lawson@ascendindiana.com) if you need assistance!


Know that we wish you all the best and hope that our paths cross in Indianapolis soon. If you do land in Indianapolis for the summer please don't hesitate to reach out, we would love to stay in touch!


All the best,


The TechPoint Team
