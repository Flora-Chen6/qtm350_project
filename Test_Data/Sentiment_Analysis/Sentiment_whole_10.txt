A brief update:

I was unfortunately laid off from Salesforce due to the current economic climate. While this was unexpected and certainly not the outcome I had hoped for, I am focused on the positives during this time.

One of the silver linings of this situation is that I now have the opportunity to spend the summer with Cam and Frankie. It's rare to have extended periods of time to dedicate solely to family. I am grateful for this unexpected break and plan to make the most of it by enjoying this time with my kids.

I'd also like to extend my support to others who may have been affected by recent layoffs. Whether you're looking for a new job opportunity or just need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

As a member of the Salesforce community, I believe in the power of networking and supporting each other through tough times. Together, we can navigate this challenging period and come out stronger on the other side.
