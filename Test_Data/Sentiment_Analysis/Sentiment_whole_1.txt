Hi everyone!
Dr. Cherribi has been kind enough to allow me to reopen the blog discussions. If you for any reason were not able to turn in the past blogs, all of them are now open until the end of the month. Please turn them in so you can receive at least partial credit! Reminder that all blogs are due the Wednesday before class at 11:59pm. 
A few students have emailed me with their blogs; please turn them in directly through Canvas so we can make sure that you have completed the assignment. 
Thank you for your participation during class, and see you next Thursday!
