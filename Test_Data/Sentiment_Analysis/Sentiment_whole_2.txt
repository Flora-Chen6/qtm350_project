Hey LinkedIn community,

After five years of dedicated service, I am currently seeking new employment opportunities following a recent round of lay offs at my previous company, Merkle (previously DEG). As a dedicated and experienced leader, I am eager to continue advancing my career and contribute to a new organization.

During my time at Merkle/DEG, I had the opportunity to work alongside some of the most talented and driven individuals in the industry. I gained valuable experience in email marketing, implementing successful campaigns for a global retail client, and building a team of self-sufficient email marketers.

I had the opportunity to grow and develop as a professional, thanks to DEGâ€™s investment in my career and individual growth - largely Adam MacDonald and Brandey Chewning Smith. I, in turn, invested my skills, expertise, and loyalty to my roles, contributing to the organization's success and growth. While the decision to part ways with Merkle was unexpected, I am eager to explore new opportunities and bring my experience to a new team.

I would love to connect with other professionals and learn more about potential leadership opportunities in the field. If you are aware of any positions that may be a good fit for someone with my experience and skill set, I would be grateful for your recommendations and insights.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
