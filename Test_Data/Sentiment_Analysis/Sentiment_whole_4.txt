Dear Students,
 
You are currently enrolled in a PE course for the Fall 2023 semester after already having completed the PE requirement. Due to the limited spaces available in PE courses in the fall, students who have already completed a PE course may only add PE to their schedule during the Add/Drop/Swap period. In the coming days, the PE department will drop your PE course. If youâ€™d like, you may enroll again in a PE course after we reach Add/Drop/Swap. Please see the highlighted section below from the registration email you received in March if you have questions about fall PE enrollment.
 
Kind regards,
Dean Ciejka
