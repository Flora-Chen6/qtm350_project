Dear all,
Paper assignment 1 is now available on Canvas. Please see the Assignments tab. You will need to take time to READ the documents attached CAREFULLY. You will also need to refer to them repeatedly as you conduct your observations and write your paper. 
Please note that we will learn some key concepts for the paper next Monday-- so don't worry if you are unsure what you'll need to do for the assignment. 
Sorry for the delay in posting the instructions. In order to compensate, I've extended the deadline. On Monday, I will briefly go over the assignment instructions again in class. 
Also, please see the updated syllabus for the course schedule. 
See you all Monday!
Best,
Prof. Park
