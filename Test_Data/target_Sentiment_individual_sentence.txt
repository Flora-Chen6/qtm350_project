The grading process should be kept confidential, including the grading guidelines, grades, and even which students you grade (I don’t want them to know which specific TA to complain about!).

While your skills and background are impressive, after assessing all of the candidates that applied for this position, we have decided to proceed with other applicants who more closely fit our needs at this time.
I would like to point out that you have no obligation to interact with students outside of your scheduled TA sessions. If you would like to set up something with students on the side, that is between you and the student.
